# Modular Consul scenarios for single datacenter installation on VMs

This repository contains code for Consul tutorials in the [HashiCorp Developer](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul) website.

Scenarios are configurable environments that make it easy to test Consul datacenter configurations and Consul features.

This repository is currently focused on ***single datacenter cofigurations***.

  <p> ⚠️ <strong>Warning:</strong> The code in this repository is currently under development and is not intended for production use. The scenarios in this repository are intended to provide a fast way to test Consul functionalities and voluntarily use not fully secured configuration to prove that Consul can be a valid tool to start introducing high grade of security even in an insecure environment.
